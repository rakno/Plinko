# Plinko
Plinko is a fun and exciting game often seen at carnivals and game shows. Players drop a ball down a vertical board filled with pegs, causing the ball to bounce and move randomly. The disc eventually lands in one of several slots at the bottom of the board. It's a game of chance that keeps players on their toes as they hope for the ball to land in a desirable slot.

It was a solo project.
